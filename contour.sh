Create X2 contours for a fit result obtained with trisens.sh.
The input <point> is the path to the output folder. Using the
parameter names of trisens.sh, the output folder names should
look like

	<root>/<mh1>_<mh2>/sensitivity/point_<value>

and <value> is the number of the fitted point.
The X2 contours are saved as histograms in the ROOT file

	<root>/<mh1>_<mh2>/contours/point_<value>.root
